cfg files for making angle TAS videos on cs games or other source games

so this is to make cool angle tas videos using cvars 
should work on any game with sv_cheats set to 1

simply navigate to the cfg folder in your game directory 
and drop all of the files in then type exec angle.cfg in your console

these will simply change your view angles and movement keys, 
we can do this with only cvars by using the thirdperson cam 
but we can sorta make this firstperson aswell

F1 bwhsw right
F2 bwhsw left
F3 hsw right
F4 hsw left
F5 sideways uhh one
F6 the other sideways
F7 backwards
F8 forwards / default

one thing to note about the hsw angles is that you should try to avoid overlapping keypresses
since each key is giving the game two inputs and it will fuck out until you let go of all the keys again

F9 fucks with cam distance to recreate a hacky-firstperson view 
but im not sure it feels kinda weird personally i prefer using thirdperson

F10 changes you back to thirdperson after F9
F11 changes your vertical pitch to look at the ground which usually looks nicer when backwards surfing 
and hitting F11 again will toggle it back to normal

thanks
