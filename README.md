# angle scripts  
cvar script files for surfing / bhopping in angles on various valve games

this wont work without sv_cheats set to 1 (but might work with client side cvar unlocker.. pls dont use online)  
so this is to make cool angle tas videos using cvars  
  
simply navigate to the cfg folder in your game directory   
drop all of the files in then type exec angle.cfg in your console  
  
these will simply change your view angles and movement keys using only in-game cvars  
we can do this with only cvars by using the thirdperson cam, without modifying any game data at all.  
  
F1 - bwhsw right  
F2 - bwhsw left  
F3 - hsw right  
F4 - hsw left  
F5 - sideways right
F6 - sideways left
F7 - backwards  
F8 - return to first person / disable scriptz  
F9 - zooms in thirdperson camera to create a hack-fix firstperson recreation - tap F9 again to disable  
F10 - make character look at ground (looks better for backwards modes) - tap F10 again to disable  
  
one thing to note about the hsw angles is that you should try to avoid overlapping keypresses  
since each key is giving the game two inputs and it will fuck out until you let go of all the keys again  
  
F9 fucks with cam distance to recreate a hacky-firstperson view  
but im not sure it feels kinda weird personally i prefer using thirdperson  
  
thanks
